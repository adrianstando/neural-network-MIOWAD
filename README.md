# Computational Intelligence Methods in Data Analysis

The project created during Computational Intelligence Methods course at Data Science studies at MiNI, Warsaw University of Technology. 

Code was written in Python and contains implemetations for three problems:

1. Neural Network
2. SOM (Self-organizing map / Kohonen's neural networks)
3. Genetic algorithm (for optimizing function value, cutting stock problem and training neural network

There are notebooks containing examples how to use code, which also show my progress in implementation.
